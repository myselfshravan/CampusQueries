# Campus Queries
Campus Queries is a web application that allows students to report Problems and Queries. The application is built using React, Next.js, and Firebase.

## Overview

Welcome to our 24-hour hackathon project, "Campus Connect: Lost & Found"! Our goal is to develop a platform that streamlines the process of reporting and recovering lost items on college campuses. The platform allows students to quickly and easily report found items, search for lost items.

## Features

- An option to upload a photo of the lost item, making it easier for the person who found it to identify.
- A map feature that shows the location where the item was last seen or found.
- A feature that allows students to mark an item as found and report it to the system.
- An option for students to set up notifications for specific items they are looking for.
- A feature that allows the administrator to verify the lost and found items before they post on the platform.
- Option to report lost items to the campus security.


## Future Implimentation
